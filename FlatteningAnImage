You can remove unecessary packages in a container with the something like:

docker container run myimage /bin/bash -c "apt-get purge -y --auto-remove wget build-essentials"

To commit a running container to a new image use:
docker container commit <container ID>  <new image name>

The image size will actually increase due to running the remove command:
Docker is copy on write and all the above did was mask out the contet rather than remove it

You can write a conainers file system out with:
docker container export -o dump.tar $(docker container ls -lq)

You can then make an image from the archive using:
docker image import dump.tar newImageName

Docker images have a history associated with them you can see it by using:
docker image history <image name>
