There are three types of networks by default. You can see these with docker network ls.
bridge - Single Host. Uses the kernel linux bridge.
  Example: docker network create -d bridge --subnet 10.0.0.1/24 ps-bridge
  Note: docker0 is always associated with the default builtin bridge network
  containers on one bridge cannot talk to containers on another bridge.
  
  If there is an existing network bidge called ps-bridge we can join containers to it like so:
  docker run -dt --name c1 --network ps-bridge apline:latest
  
  If you create a container with a name flag every docker engine has an embedded dns service so they can talk
  with each other by name. As long as they are on the same network.
  
host - 
none

Overlay lets you create a network for containers to talk to each other over.


docker network inspect <network name> lets you see details of the the network.
You may wish to install bridge-utils with: sudo apt-get bridge-utils This will let you use: brctl show

You can also use docker link show


###MULTI HOST NETWORKING###
First thing is to enable swarm on all nodes:
docker swarm init

The above command will output the command you need to run on other nodes to join the swarm.

docker node ls 
will show you all the nodes in the swarm

This will also create docker_gwbridge and ingerss networks

docker network create -d overlay ps-over
creates a new overlay network

Other nodes in the swarm will not see this network until we create a container on that node that
needs to use it.

For example, if you create a service on the master node like so:
docker service create --name ps-svc --network ps-over --replicas 2 alpine sleep 1d

We can then check the services with:
docker service ps ps-svc
