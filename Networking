There are three types of networks by default. You can see these with docker network ls.
bridge - Single Host. Uses the kernel linux bridge.
  Example: docker network create -d bridge --subnet 10.0.0.1/24 ps-bridge
  Note: docker0 is always associated with the default builtin bridge network
  containers on one bridge cannot talk to containers on another bridge.
  
  If there is an existing network bidge called ps-bridge we can join containers to it like so:
  docker run -dt --name c1 --network ps-bridge apline:latest
  
  If you create a container with a name flag every docker engine has an embedded dns service so they can talk
  with each other by name. As long as they are on the same network.
  
host - 
none

Overlay lets you create a network for containers to talk to each other over.


docker network inspect <network name> lets you see details of the the network.
You may wish to install bridge-utils with: sudo apt-get bridge-utils This will let you use: brctl show

You can also use docker link show
